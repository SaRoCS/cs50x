Stock Education

This project is a virtual stock market that is meant for educational purposes.  When first creating an account one must select whether they are a teacher or a student.
If you are using this for personal uses pleases select "teacher" as this will allow you access to all of the available features.  Once you have created an account,
you can start buying and selling stocks.  If you need more cash in your account or you need to change your password, just head to the "Profile" section.  If you are using this
for education and you are a teacher please create a class for your students to join.  You will need to give your students the class key so that they can log in to the class.
Once in a class, the members will be ranked by their total value which is the sum of their cash and the current price of their stocks.  If you are a student you will not be
able to see the other members's portfolios, but if you are a teacher you can check on all of your students's portfolios.
