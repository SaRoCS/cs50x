        <h2>Childhood</h2>
        <p class='mytext'>
            Thompson looked around but could not see through the darkness.
            As he started off, two sets of brilliant green orbs cut through the dark.
            Sprinting with anticipation, Dr. Thompson emerged at the top of the temple.
            And there, at the top of stairs, at the top of the temple, and at the top of Aztec religion, rested the Eye of Quetzalcoatl.
            Stone, cut in the likeness of an eye and engraved in ancient symbols, surrounded the prize gem of the Aztecs.
            The pupil of the Eye flickered with dazzling blues and greens as it caught the last lights of day.
        </p>
        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p class='mytext'>
            Once Dr. Thompson grabbed the Eye, the serpents, who had been silently watching, made their move.
            Springing from the stairwell they flung themselves at Thompson.
            Thompson turned just in time to see a feathered serpent sail inches from his face off the temple.
            Without any hesitation he jumped, sliding down the walls of the temple.
            Hitting the ground running, Thompson dashed for the jeep with the second serpent in hot pursuit.
            In the jeep, he stepped on the gas.
            Even at thirty miles per hour, the serpent was nipping at the doctor’s heels.
            But soon, the temple’s power stopped and the serpent became once more, just a carving.
            “Well,” said Dr. Thompson, “ that’s one more thing I’ve outran,” and with that he drove off Eye in hand.

        </p>
        <h2>Family</h2>
        <p class='mytext'>
            Deep in the heart of the jungles of Mexico, Dr. Thompson was on the run.
            This time he was escaping the clutches of a panther he had angered while searching for food.
            For Dr. Thompson, being chased around by wild animals was a regular occurance.
            Throughout his life as an archaeologist, he had been pursued by everything from a herd of elephants to enraged natives.
            Most of these events occurred while he was searching for some historical artifact, but today was different.
            Today, Dr. Thompson was looking for something of myth, not historical fact.
            He was searching for the legendary Eye of Quetzalcoatl.
