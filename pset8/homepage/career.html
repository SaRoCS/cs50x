                This time he was escaping the clutches of a panther he had angered while searching for food.
                For Dr. Thompson, being chased around by wild animals was a regular occurance.

                Today, Dr. Thompson was looking for something of myth, not historical fact.
                He was searching for the legendary Eye of Quetzalcoatl.
                In the old Aztec myths, this Eye could be found at the top of the temple to Quetzalcoatl.
                After studying maps and myths, Dr. Thompson had finally discovered the location of the temple.
