                The next day Thompson rented a jeep and packed up.
                The journey took three days across rough terrain.
                Upon approaching the temple, Dr. Thompson stopped in awe.
                In front of him was a six tiered Aztec temple, the largest he had seen.
                As Thompson approached the entrance, he noticed feathered serpents made of jade flanking the doorway.
                What he did not notice, was that as he passed through the doorway, the serpents’ emerald eyes flamed to life.
                Finding the nearest stairway, Dr. Thompson started his ascent.
                In the heart of the temple, Thompson suddenly stopped, for he had heard a sound.
